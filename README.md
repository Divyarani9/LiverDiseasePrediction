# LiverDiseasePrediction
Supervised machine learning model to predict whether patient has liver disease or not.


# Problem Statement

Liver data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non liver patient records.The data set was collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. Selector is a class label used to divide into groups(liver patient or not). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records. The predicted output obtained from the classification algorithm gives a fair idea about the chances of a patient being Liver Patient or not.

# Technologies used:
For this project, the model has been built in Jupyter Notebook IDE using Python language and then the front end has been developed in Spyder IDE using Dash web developemnt framework.
- Exploratory data analysis is done and applied feature engineering
- Applied supervised machine algorithms for classification and predict where patient is affected by liver diaease or not.
- Used SMOTE technique for balancing the dataset
